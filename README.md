Gold vs. S&P 500 Outperformance Prediction

Team 5: Anabella Trias and Anthony Sierra

Predicting 90-day gold outperformance using macroeconomic time-series data (2006–2024)

🔍 Overview

This project builds a binary classification model that predicts whether gold will outperform the S&P 500 over a 90-day horizon, using 18 years of macroeconomic and financial indicators.

The goal is to explore feature engineering, time-series modeling, and evaluation strategies for tactical asset-allocation signals.

Data Sources

Combined 11 datasets from Investing.com and FRED (2006–2024), including:
	•	Gold spot price
	•	S&P 500 index
	•	CPI (inflation)
	•	Crude oil
	•	Federal funds rate
	•	VIX (volatility index)
	•	Treasury yields (2Y, 10Y)
	•	USD index
	•	Labor data
	•	Recession indicators

Final processed dataset: 4,000+ daily observations.

Problem Definition

Target:
Gold outperforms the S&P 500 over the next 90 days (1 if true, 0 otherwise).

Type:
Binary classification on time-dependent data.

⸻

Feature Engineering

Created 40+ features using pandas and NumPy, including:

Market & Price Features
	•	Daily & rolling returns
	•	30/60/90-day momentum
	•	Rolling means (7/14/30 days)
	•	Rolling volatility
	•	Drawdown metrics

Macroeconomic Indicators
	•	Inflation changes
	•	Yield curve slope
	•	USD strength
	•	Oil price fluctuations
	•	Volatility spikes (VIX)

Target Construction
	•	90-day forward relative return:
gold_future_return - sp500_future_return

⸻

Exploratory Analysis

Key patterns identified:
	•	Gold’s strongest relative performance spikes align with crisis periods (2008, 2020).
	•	Increasing VIX, falling yields, and USD volatility strongly correlate with gold outperformance.
	•	Distribution shapes vary significantly pre- and post-2013.

Modeling Approach

Models Evaluated
	•	Logistic Regression (balanced)
	•	Random Forest
	•	XGBoost

Time-Based Split

To prevent leakage:
	•	Train: earlier years
	•	Test: later years

Performance (Best Model)

Logistic Regression (balanced):
	•	ROC AUC: 0.753
	•	Recall: 82.6%
	•	Precision: 59.2%
	•	Prioritizes recall to maximize signal detection in tactical allocation strategies.

In-Progress Work
	•	Benchmarking with PyCaret to compare automated ML workflows against manual baselines
  •	Creation of Streamlit/FastAPI dashboard 

⸻

Tech Stack
	•	Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebooks
	•	Conda environment
